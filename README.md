Custom level pack for Baba Is You.

This custom level pack focuses on editor-exclusive words (except PHANTOM and LOCKED since they appeared after I have finished the majority of the pack). It contains 27 numbered levels, 9 extras and secrets. The pack is divided into several sections, and the first sections is mainly tutorials. In some levels (especially early ones), you may not be able to modify any rules. These levels are mainly introductions, puzzles, or for fun.
Please do not look at the level pack inside Baba Is You's level editor since it will give heavy spoilers.

To play: Download Babasynthesis.zip from the releases. Unzip it inside the Worlds folder of your Baba Is You local files. Currently you have to be in beta to be able to play custom level packs.

If you find this level pack fun, feel free to share it. Though you should not modify and redistribute it without notifying me.
